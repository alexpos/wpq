The easiest way to battle spam is to activate #Akismet. To activate it, go here: [akismet.com/signup][aki]. 

But, there are several alternatives to Akismet:

- [Molllom][mol] the same idea as akismet, free and paid plans
- [WP Conditional Captcha] adds a captcha if Akismet blogs a comment {% include wplugin.html %}
- [Antispam Bee][bee] popular free alternative to Akismet  {% include wplugin.html %}
- [Spam Destroyer][des] free alternative to Akismet  {% include wplugin.html %}
- [Growmap Anti-spambot][gro] very simple anti-spam idea: use a checkbox  {% include wplugin.html %}

And finally: [Discuss][dis] - this is a completely seperate commenting system, running on Discuss' own servers
