#Testing WordPress themes

Switching your theme is very simple on WordPress. Just go to **Appearance > Themes** and select the theme you want. But when to do this? Many themes need customising before they work well, and you don't want your site to look half-finished.

Comes in [Theme Test Drive][ttd] {% include wplugin.html %}. This plugin enables your new theme only for admin users, regular visitors see the old site.
