There are an enormous amount of contact forms for WordPress, ranging from simple to complete contact- and meeting-solutions.

Easy - very good looking interface, but takes a while to implement
Fast Secure - powerful
Contact Form 7 - powerful
Usernoise, messages are received inside WordPress, but nice and simple

Contact forms are the simplest way to get feedback. These are the best feedback plugins. What is best for you depends on so many factors that it is hard to say which of these is the best for you:

| Plugin    | flexibility | difficulty | notes | 
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| [Contact Form 7][cf7] | 5 | 4 | none |
| [Popup Contact Form][pcf] | ? | ? | ? |
| [Quick Contact Form][qcf] | ? | ? | ? |
| [Popup Contact Form][pcf] | ? | ? | ? |
| [Popup Contact Form][pcf] | ? | ? | ? |
| [Gravity forms][gfr] | ? | ? | Starts at $$$ |

You can find a nice side-by-side comparison [here][8bc].

Contact Form 7 has the habit of adding lots of code to all pages, even if the plugin is not used on that specific page. This plugin cleans up that behavior.

One ofthe most powerful plugins to work with forms is [Contact Form 7][cf7]. However, if you want a truly powerful plugin, then you should consider checking out Gravity Forms. We use this plugin extensively throughout our sites as well as on our client’s site. It allows you to collect payments through contact form, capture emails for optin, and much more. Here is a simple tutorial on how we used Gravity Forms to create a donate form for a non-profit.
