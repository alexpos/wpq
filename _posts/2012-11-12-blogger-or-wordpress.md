Here we compare [Blogger][bl], josted by Google, [WordPress.com][wp], hosted by automatic, and [WordPress.org][w2], which you have to host yourself.

conclusion: The three services are more alike then different, and all have their advantages. All three of them work well. If you just want a simple blog, **Blogger** might be simpler. If you ever want to grow your blog or want to do something a bit more customised, then **WordPress** will give both you both an easier upgrade-path and more possibilities.

| Feature | [Blogger][bl] | [Wordpress.com][wp] | [Wordpress.org][w2] |
|---------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Startup costs | free | free | $$ depends on hosting-plan |
| Address | .blogspot.com | .wordpress.com | any |
| Custom domain | yes | yes $$ | yes $$ |
| Languages | about 50 | > 120 | > 120 |
| Custom html/css | yes | yes $$ | yes |
| Storage | 1GB | 3GB | unlimeted (depends on $$) |
| Ad Free? | yes | no | yes |
| Display ads | yes | no | yes |
| SEO | yes | yes | yes |
| Google Analytics | yes | no (own analytics) | yes (+other) |
| Adding content | simple and easy | harder but more powerful | harder but more powerful |
| Social Media | yes | yes + auto-posting | yes + auto-posting | 
| Password protect posts | no | yes | yes |
| Edit comments | no | yes | yes |
| Importing posts | only from blogspot | yes (many) | yes (many) |
| Team blogs | yes, admin or editor | yes, administrator, editors, authors, subscribers, and contributors | yes, administrator, editors, authors, subscribers, and contributors + more with plugin | 
| Easily export data | no | yes | yes |

Overall, Blogger's main advantage is simplicity. Everything is as simple as can be, but if you stray too far from the fold you will run into limitations. Wordpress.com is a little bit harder, but more powerful. Some of that functionality will cost money. Wordpress.org is the hardest of the three, but easily the most powerful.
