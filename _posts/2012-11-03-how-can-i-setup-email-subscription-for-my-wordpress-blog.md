There are two methods that you can use. This can be done for free by using FeedBurner however in our recent experience, FeedBurner has proven itself extremely unreliable. We recommend using MailChimp and setup RSS-to-Email Campaign. It is free for upto 2,000 emails. You will have to start paying after that. You can also use Aweber for this.
