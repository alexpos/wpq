Email subscriptions offer visitors a way to subscribe to new posts via e-mail. It is easy to setup and after that is done no more work is needed.

These are the five major plugins / services:

- [Feedburner][fbg] email alerts - [plugins][fbp]{% include wplugin.html %}, Automatically integrated with Google Analytics
- [Subscribe2][sb2]{% include wplugin.html %} - stats available in Google Analytics
- “Email subscription” delivered by [JetPack][jpw]{% include wplugin.html %}
- [MailChimp’s][mlc] Rss to Email: free under 2000 subscribers ([lots of plugins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tags/mailchimp){% include wplugin.html %})
- [Aweber][awe] - like MailChimp, but starts at $1 ([plugins][awp]{% include wplugin.html %})

Feedburner and MailChimp are probably the most popular ones.
