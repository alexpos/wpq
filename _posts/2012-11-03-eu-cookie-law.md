There are several good tools to make your site comply to the cookie law:

- [Cookie Law][civ] (has a nice frontend to 'Cookie Control', below)
- [Cookie Control][ccp] {% include wplugin.html %}
- [Cookiecuttr][cct] 
- [EU Cookie Wet WP plugin][eup] {% include wplugin.html %}
- [EU Cookie Directive plugin][euc] {% include wplugin.html %}

Many sites have seen in Analytics that their visiting-rate dropped considerably when using too obvious forms, and hve since gone back to only using a privacy statement or putting the message on the bottom of the page (a good example [here][nos], look at the right bottom. It uses [Cookie Law][civ].

Two good explanations what the cookie-law means for wordpress are [EU Cookie law compliance in wordpress][jon] and [Wordpres en de cookiewet][nos] (Dutch).
