##Cookies

Cookies are used to remember preferences that are chosen by the user when using WQP. For example, the preferred color-theme in which to view WPQ is stored in a cookie so that this language is selected when the user returns to the Web site. No personal information is collected by or stored in cookies.

##Active Scripting or JavaScript

Scripting is used by WPQ to improve the functionality of the Web site. Using scripting technology allows WPQ to return information more quickly to the user. Scripting is never used by WPQ to install software on the userâ€™s computer or to collect unauthorized information from the user.

Active scripting or JavaScript must be enabled in the browser for some portions of WPQ to work correctly. Most Web browsers allow this feature to be enabled or disabled for specific Web sites. Consult the Web browser help documentation to learn how to enable scripting for selected Web sites.

If ever it proves necessary to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it.
