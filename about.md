##Why

The idea of this site is a simple resource with the most commen questions people ask about Wordpress. After having answered the same question over and over, I thought it would be a good idea to save all the answers for future reference.

##How

This site does not run on Wordpress, ironically. It is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site, hosted on [github](http://github.com). If you want you can take a look / fork it, you can do that [here](https://github.com/plovs/wpq).

The tools used to build this site are [Zurb foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome), [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Quickstart-Jekyll-Zurb](https://github.com/lvillani/quickstart-jekyll-zurb).
